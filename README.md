# Art Timelapse
This program lets you create efficient timelapses of your drawing.

### Why
I made this program to be used primarily with Paint Tool SAIv2, (which does not have any builtin timelapse tool), however it can be used with any other program.
Previously I was reluctant to record drawing videos with OBS Studio, because I would have to do post-processing on every video:
Cutting dead air from the videos; Concatenating separate recordings together; Speeding up the resulting video to make a timelapse.
While it is possible to mitigate these issues when using OBS Studio, I wanted a more accurate solution that works sort of like Clip Studio's timelapse feature.
By recording the end of each stroke of a drawing, you get the largest amount of information about the timelapse without any redundancy, which can end up creating compact videos with minimal editing.

### GUI usage
- The default mode is to run a GUI and most options have tooltips.

### Command line usage
- Use `--cli` to run the program as a command line tool. Use `--help` to see all options.
- Specify `--frames <folder>` recorded data to a directory. If not specified, it will use a timestamp as the file name.
- The default video storage format is `webm` with `vp80` codec to have better color preservation (compared to `mp4`).
  - You may see a warning that `vp80` is not supported for `webm`. This appears to be a bug in OpenCV that you can ignore.
- You can specify a custom `--container <suffix>` and fourcc `--codec <fourcc>` when recording or exporting, whatever is supported by OpenCV and FFMPEG, for example `--container mp4 --codec mp4v`.
  - Incompatible containers and codecs will display errors and might not produce any resulting video file.
- If you specify `--web`, the `container` and `codec` are set to `mp4` and `avc1` respectively. This format is accepted by many websites for upload, but it can reduce color quality. This is best used when exporting (with `--export`). If you really need to save disk space, then recording with `--web` will be very efficient.
- You can export the saved frame data with `--export`. By default the video will try to be made no longer than 60 seconds, like a typical timelapse, but you can override it with `--export-time-limit <seconds>`. Set it to 0 to have no limit on the export length.

| Format | Quality | Size (relative to MP4) | Estimated size (~25k 1000px frames recorded) |
|--|--|--|--|
| mp4 (avc1) | Some colors will look off from the original | 1x | 15 MB |
| webm (vp80) | Colors look more accurate | 10x | 150 MB |

#### SAI memory capture
- If using `--sai`, the program will read frames directly from the running SAI instance.
- It will ask you which opened canvas you want to record.
- It will try to automatically find the window of SAI to track clicks, but if it cannot find the window, you will be asked to click on SAI's window instead.
- It will only record a new frame if it is different from the last frame, as to prevent clicks on other parts of the program from creating redundant frames.
- This mode will not work natively on MacOS because PyMemoryEditor does not have a MacOS implementation. You might be able to run this program in Wine on MacOS to get around this.
- I think that this mode provides the best looking timelapse for SAI.
- This mode has to be updated for each new version of SAI, so it may not be compatible with the latest version of SAI as it's released.
#### PSD capture
- If using `--psd-file <filename>`, a frame will be captured every time the PSD file is finished being written to (such as after saving).
- This mode will make a choppy looking timelapse, depending on how frequently you save your work, but the effect isn't terrible.
#### Screen capture
- This is the default behavior of the program when neither of the above options is specified, which is to capture an area of the screen.
- When you run the program, it will ask you to click on the window which you want to start capturing.
  - If using Paint Tool SAI with Windows, click inside of the drawing area to automatically capture that subwindow.
  - If you are using Paint Tool SAI with Wine, you can use the `--drag-grab` option to drag a rectangular area to record.
- This mode will make a timelapse that looks like a screen recording with software like OBS. Depending on how short you compress the timelapse to, this can look somewhat disorienting, particularly if you zoom or rotate a lot.

### Examples
Record from SAI's memory directly and store the outputs into a directory called `test`:
```
art-timelapse --cli --frames test --sai
```
Interactive setup:
```
Press Ctrl+C here to stop at any time
Writing to frames folder: test; container webm; codec vp80
Select a canvas to record (Ctrl+C to cancel):
[1] NewCanvas16 ()
[2] NewCanvas17 ()
Enter index [1-2]:2
Could not find window automatically
Click on a subwindow to start recording. Right click to cancel.
Tracking input for window: Default - Wine desktop
OpenCV: FFMPEG: tag 0x30387076/'vp80' is not supported with codec id 139 and format 'webm / WebM'
^C
```
Finishing recording (pressed Ctrl+C).

The export type is inferred from the `--frames` path:
```
art-timelapse --cli --frames test --sai --export --web
```
Output:
```
Press Ctrl+C here to stop at any time
Reading from frames folder: test
Writing to video: test.mp4 (avc1)
100%|████████████████████████████| 26/26 [00:00<00:00, 184.61frames/s]
```

### Windows prebuilt executable (pyinstaller)
You can find prebuilt executables in the releases page instead of going through the source installation https://github.com/cromachina/art-timelapse/releases. It may still depend on ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) being installed separately and added to the exe directory. One caveat of using the prebuilt pyinstaller executable is that it has a pretty slow startup time.

### Installing from source on Windows
- This method starts faster than the pyinstaller executable.
- Install python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (add to your system PATH)
  - Alternatively: `winget install python`
- Install ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
  - Alternatively: `winget install ffmpeg`
- With virtual environment:
  - Download the source to some location.
  - In the source directory, create a virtual environment: `python -m venv --system-site-packages venv`
  - Activate the virtual environment: `venv/bin/activate`
  - Install the project: `pip install -e .`
  - `art-timelapse` is now available in the current shell. You have to reactivate the venv if you open a new shell.
- Global install:
  - `pip install https://github.com/cromachina/art-timelapse/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`
  - The Python `Scripts` directory must be in your environment variables PATH to be able to run from any shell, for example:
    - `C:\Users\<Your-Username>\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.13_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python313\Scripts`
- Run with: `art-timelapse`
- This can be done similarly on Linux and MacOS, but you should use the Nix method instead.

### Installing with Nix on Ubuntu (or other Linux distros)
- Initial nix setup:
  - Install nix (may differ for your distro): `sudo apt install nix-bin`
  - Add yourself to the `nix-users` group: ``sudo usermod -a -G nix-users `whoami` ``
  - Refresh the group for your session: `newgrp nix-users`
  - Update `nix.conf` so you can use flakes:
    - `echo "extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf`
- Run: `nix run github:cromachina/art-timelapse`
- Run a specific version: `nix run github:cromachina/art-timelapse/v2.0.0`
- Optional: Consider using `system-manager` if you want to install in a persistent config file: https://github.com/numtide/system-manager

### Installing on NixOS
- Make sure experimental features are enabled for `nix-command` and `flakes`.
- Example, run from source directory: `nix run .#`
- Example, run from git: `nix run github:cromachina/art-timelapse`
- Example, add to your `configuration.nix` so you can run `art-timelapse` directly:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  (builtins.getFlake "github:cromachina/art-timelapse/v2.0.0").packages.${pkgs.system}.default
];
```

### Todo
- Maybe make a simple GUI.
